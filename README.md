# WEB Scraping & web interface for data 

Scrape data from the website [chennai_rainwater](http://123.63.203.150/avgrain.htm) , [chennai_rainwater2](http://123.63.203.150/avgrain03.htm)

## Description 
* scrapping.py file in the repository is python based code for scrapping data from the websites. Code contains pandas and beautifulsoup library to scrape data and store that as pandas DataFrame. Further code stores scraped data in .csv file in local storage. 

* Dataset.csv is file for storing scrapped data in tabular form. Its generated by running scrapping.py 

* webpage.py is written in python language using Flask framework and Matplotlib libraries to showcase data on web interface. 
* The file runs on local server. Web interface contains two html pages one for displaying data in tabular form and other for visualisation of data.
* For this assignment data for months January, February, March and April are plotted over the range of year 1965 to 2018.
* For generating html webpage.py uses .html file present in /templates folder. Styling of tabular data is done using css script present in /static folder. 

**Its important that these two folders(/templates and /static) along with Dataset.csv file and webpage.py should be in same directory.**

* After running webpage.py results can be seen by passing following urls in web browser

"http://127.0.0.1:5000/tables == shows tabular form data (localhost)
"http://127.0.0.1:5000/visulization" == visualisation of data (localhost)
